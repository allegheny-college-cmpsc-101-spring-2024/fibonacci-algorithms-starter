# Fibonacci Algorithms

TODO: Make sure that you delete all of the TODO markers and either delete
and/or rephrase all of the prompts inside of this file. When you are finished
writing this reflection it should contain technical details, empirical results,
and an analysis of the results that are suitable for publication on your
professional web site. You should also make sure that there are no writing
mistakes or mistakes in the use of Markdown inside of this file.

TODO: Please note that there are certain packages used in the source code for
this project that may not work and/or be fully supported on the Windows and MacOS
operating systems. This is due to the fact that these operating systems do not
provide certain standard features that are available in the Linux operating
system. Please check with the course instructor if it seems that your operating
system does not support certain packages or it yields unexpected results.

## Program Output

### Eight different runs of `fibonaccicreator` for comparison experiment

TODO: Use eight fenced code blocks to provide the outputs under the headings
below.

TODO: Read these next TODOs to understand how to run your experiment.

TODO: If an algorithm does not work correctly and you can explain why it does
not work, then please provide that output in one of the fenced code blocks
under the correct heading below.

TODO: Whenever possible, please use the same "small" and "large" inputs for both
the List-based and Tuple-based algorithms.

TODO: Use the `--pyinstrument` command-line argument to open up a web-based display
of the call profile from running your program. You can use this output to understand
the other profiling information that `fibonaccicreator` can produce.

TODO: Do not run the program with the `--display` option when conducting
experiments!

TODO: Document and justify your choice for the `number` parameter.

TODO: You can place all of the fenced code blocks in the following sections.

#### Two outputs from running the `iterativetuple`

TODO: Provide the output for running `iterativetuple` with a large and small input
TODO: Use fenced code blocks to provide the requested outputs

#### Two outputs from running the `iterativelist`

TODO: Provide the output for running `iterativelist` with a large and small input
TODO: Use fenced code blocks to provide the requested outputs

#### Two outputs from running the `recursivetuple`

TODO: Provide the output for running `recursivetuple` with a large and small input
TODO: Use fenced code blocks to provide the requested outputs

#### Two outputs from running the `recursivelist`

TODO: Provide the output for running `recursivelist` with a large and small input
TODO: Use fenced code blocks to provide the requested output

## Performance Analysis

TODO: Provide five paragraphs that explain which algorithm is fastest, by how
much it is faster, and how you knew that it was faster, referencing the data
in the previously recorded outputs to support your response. You should make
sure that you answer the following research questions (RQs):

- RQ: Is `fibonaccicreator` faster with a list or a tuple?
- RQ: Is `fibonaccicreator` faster with recursion or iteration?
- RQ: Overall, what is the fastest approach when using `fibonaccicreator`?
- RQ: Overall, what is the most memory efficient approach when using `fibonaccicreator`?
- RQ: Overall, what are inappropriate approaches for computing Fibonacci numbers?

TODO: Make sure that your responses explain WHY certain algorithms are faster.
TODO: It is not sufficient to only explain WHICH algorithm is faster.
TODO: Make sure that your responses explain WHY certain algorithms use less memory.
TODO: It is not sufficient to only explain WHICH algorithm algorithm uses less memory.
TODO: Make sure that you explain why certain algorithms are not suitable.
TODO: If you had to modify the way in which `fibonaccicreator` collected either
      execution time or memory overhead information, please explain and justify your changes.

## Source Code
