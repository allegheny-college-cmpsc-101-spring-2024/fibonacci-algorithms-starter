## Program Output

### Eight different runs of `fibonaccicreator` for comparison experiment

TODO: Use eight fenced code blocks to provide the outputs under the headings
below.

TODO: Read these next instructions to understand how to run your experiment.

- If an algorithm does not work correctly and you can explain why it does
  not work, then please provide that output in one of the fenced code blocks
  under the correct heading below.
- Whenever possible, please use the same "small" and "large" inputs for both
  the List-based and Tuple-based algorithms.
- Use the `--pyinstrument` command-line argument to open up a web-based display
  of the call profile from running your program. You can use this output to understand
  the other profiling information that `fibonaccicreator` can produce.
- Do not run the program with the `--display` option when conducting
  experiments!
- Document and justify your choice for the `number` parameter.
- You can place all of the fenced code blocks in the following sections.

#### Two outputs from running the `iterativetuple`

TODO: Provide the output for running `iterativetuple` with a large and small input
TODO: Use fenced code blocks to provide the requested outputs

#### Two outputs from running the `iterativelist`

TODO: Provide the output for running `iterativelist` with a large and small input
TODO: Use fenced code blocks to provide the requested outputs

#### Two outputs from running the `recursivetuple`

TODO: Provide the output for running `recursivetuple` with a large and small input
TODO: Use fenced code blocks to provide the requested outputs

#### Two outputs from running the `recursivelist`

TODO: Provide the output for running `recursivelist` with a large and small input
TODO: Use fenced code blocks to provide the requested output

## Performance Analysis

TODO: Provide five paragraphs that explain which algorithm is fastest, by how
much it is faster, and how you knew that it was faster, referencing the data
in the previously recorded outputs to support your response. You should make
sure that you answer the following research questions (RQs):

- RQ: Is `fibonaccicreator` faster with a list or a tuple?
- RQ: Is `fibonaccicreator` faster with recursion or iteration?
- RQ: Overall, what is the fastest approach when using `fibonaccicreator`?
- RQ: Overall, what is the most memory efficient approach when using `fibonaccicreator`?
- RQ: Overall, what are inappropriate approaches for computing Fibonacci numbers?

TODO: Make sure that your responses explain WHY certain algorithms are faster.
TODO: It is not sufficient to only explain WHICH algorithm is faster.
TODO: Make sure that your responses explain WHY certain algorithms use less memory.
TODO: It is not sufficient to only explain WHICH algorithm algorithm uses less memory.
TODO: Make sure that you explain why certain algorithms are not suitable.
TODO: If you had to modify the way in which `fibonaccicreator` collected either
      execution time or memory overhead information, please explain and justify your changes.
